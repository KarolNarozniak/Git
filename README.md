I've created simple physics engine, for simpulating bouncing ball between squares
Input is a number or blocks on the map and the angle in which the ball will be going 
Your goal is to hit as much squares ass possible, by inputing right angle, becouse it lets you play it longer 
After 30 s + 1s for every hit the game will be done and you have to start again
sometimes ball will get stuck between something or bounce wrong, propobly there is somethong wrong with the code but after all it's working and it's preety fun to watch
